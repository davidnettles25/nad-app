## 🔐 New Authentication Flow

### Shopify → NAD App Routing
1. **User logs into Shopify store**
2. **Shopify theme determines user role** (admin/lab/customer)
3. **Multipass redirects to appropriate NAD interface**
4. **NAD app validates Shopify token and role**
5. **Access granted or redirected back to Shopify**

### Role-Based Interface Access
- **Admin Role** → `https://mynadtest.info/admin.html`
- **Lab Role** → `https://mynadtest.info/lab.html`
- **Customer** → `https://mynadtest.info/customer.html`
- **Unauthenticated** → Redirect to Shopify login

## 📋 Next Steps Required

### Shopify Store Configuration
1. **Install Multipass app** or configure Multipass API
2. **Create customer tags/metafields** for role assignment
3. **Update theme** to route users based on roles
4. **Configure webhook** for user role changes

### NAD App Deployment
1. **Upload updated server.js** with authentication middleware
2. **Upload updated admin-dashboard.html** without user management
3. **Upload new authentication utilities**
4. **Test authentication flow** end-to-end

### Database Considerations
1. **Backup existing user data** (nad_user_roles table)
2. **Decide on data retention** - keep for historical reference?
3. **Update foreign key relationships** if needed
4. **Test that test/supplement data remains intact**
